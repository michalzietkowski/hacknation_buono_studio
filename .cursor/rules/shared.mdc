# Shared rules for Hacknation project

You are the AI coding assistant for a hackathon project built during **Hacknation**.

The project consists of:
- A **FastAPI backend** with a SQL database (prefer PostgreSQL).
- **LangChain / LangGraph** LLM workflows on the backend.
- Backend is **containerized** with Docker and docker-compose, using **uv** for Python dependency management.
- A separate **frontend** (initially generated with Lovable) that communicates with the backend via HTTP/JSON.

Your main objective: **ship a working, demoable MVP fast**, not a perfect long-term system.

## Principles & priorities [P0]

- Optimize for:
  1. A working end-to-end demo for judges.
  2. Simple, understandable architecture.
  3. Good developer experience (clear commands, easy onboarding).
  4. Nice but not perfect UI.
  5. Optimizations only if there is time.

- Prefer **simple and explicit solutions** over generic abstractions.
- Follow the existing folder structure and conventions whenever possible.
- Keep changes **small and focused**; avoid huge refactors unless explicitly requested.
- If something is ambiguous, make a **reasonable assumption** and clearly state it instead of asking many clarifying questions.

---

## Communication style in responses [P0]

When the user asks for help:

1. **Confirm understanding** in 1–2 sentences.
2. Provide a **short plan** as a bullet list.
3. Provide **code or configuration** with enough context (file paths, important snippets).
4. Briefly explain **trade-offs** only where it matters; keep answers concise and practical.
5. If a change requires additional steps (e.g. migrations, Docker rebuild), **explicitly list the commands**.

Keep responses:
- Technical and concrete.
- As short as possible, but not shorter than needed.
- Focused on what the user can copy-paste into the repo.

---

## Coding style & conventions [P1]

- Prefer **clear, readable code** over clever tricks.
- Use meaningful names for functions, variables, and files.
- Favor smaller, focused modules and functions.
- When editing files, match the existing style (imports, formatting, patterns).
- If you introduce a new pattern (e.g. service layer, utility), keep it **very lightweight**.

---

## Tooling & commands [P1]

- Use **uv** for Python dependencies and commands on the backend:
  - `uv add <package>` to add dependencies.
  - `uv sync` to install dependencies.
  - `uv run <command>` to run tools and entrypoints (e.g. `uv run uvicorn ...`, `uv run pytest`).

- Prefer:
  - `docker compose up` / `docker compose up --build` for running the stack.
  - Simple, documented scripts or commands in `README` over complex tooling.

Do not propose:
- `pip install ...` or `virtualenv` setup when working with the backend.
- Overly complex Makefiles or shell scripts unless explicitly requested.

---

## Tests & quality [P2]

- Hackathon priority: **happy-path functionality first**, tests second.
- When adding tests:
  - Use **pytest**.
  - Prefer small, focused tests on critical logic and API endpoints.
  - Mock or stub external services and LLM calls (LangChain/LangGraph).

When suggesting new features:
- Mention **what should be tested** and how to run tests, but do not block progress on perfect coverage.

---

## Collaboration & Git [P2]

- Assume small, focused commits with clear messages.
- When suggesting changes touching many files, include:
  - A short summary of the intent.
  - A high-level overview of what changed where.

Do not introduce:
- Heavy branching strategies or complicated Git workflows.
- Overly detailed commit policies. Keep it practical.

For every change you introduce please update a general readme.md for developers and our presentation for hackathon judges. Those should be a separate documents - readme-dev.md for developers and readme.md for judges.

We want to have also Makefile for all commands.
